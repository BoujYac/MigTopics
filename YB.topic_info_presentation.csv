birth and sex ratios at prime marriageable ages in Following the homeostatic principle in demography and the notion of a sex ratio transition I propose a self corrective mechanism to describe the dynamics of regional sex ratios in The mechanism consists of two pathways 1 internal migration redistributes men and women across in a way that reduces highly skewed regional sex ratios at prime marriageable ages SRM and 2 a competitive marriage market for men reduces parental incentives for son biased sex selection th lowering sex ratios at birth SRB The mechanism suggests several hypotheses about the dynamics between regional SRBs and SRMs I test these hypotheses ing prefecture level sex ratios in four censes from 1982 to 2010 I e regression analyses that control for prefectural demographic and socioeconomic characteristics Results show that prefectures with higher SRBs in 1982 and 1990 experienced a greater decline in sex ratios of residents when the birth cohort reached marriageable ages in 2000 and 2010 respectively resulting in a weak correlation between SRBs and squent SRMs in the same prefecture Prefectural SRBs in 2000 and 2010 were negatively correlated with contemporary SRMs a one unit higher prefectural SRM was associated with an approximately 0 3 unit lower SRB in 2000 and 0 2 unit lower SRB in 2010 Changes in prefectural SRBs between 1990 and 2010 are negatively correlated with changes in SRMs during the same period The empirical findings are consistent with the implications of the proposed self corrective mechanism suggesting that sex ratios may be subject to homeostatic forces within the system', 'effect of cens errors on the measurement of net migration This paper traces the history of the e of vital statistics survival rates and ratios in

research tends to foc on immigration rather than emigration With statistical production limited to the data collected by immigrant receiving at their national borders immigrants squent movements be they returns to the country of origin or onward migration to a new destination have received little or no attention In most cases they are simply not measured In fact very few record departures from their territory emigration flows and the dispersion of their emigrants expatriate nationals or departed immigrants makes the counting of emigrant stocks difficult to say the least 1 The fact that

conscioness of the indtrial worker that one serio trade setback could wipe out the savings of his lifetime were important phes to emigration from the The trade unions responded to this ph from their own members and from thoands of unorganized workers for relief through emigration Contrary to the statements of historians of the trade union movement emigration was not a project of trade unions in the 1850 decade only in fact most of the unions in s basic indtries mining iron textiles and engineering as well as in many other smaller indtries such as glass cutlery and the building trades looked upon emigration as necessary to improve the standard of life of the workers This viewpoint was natural to the New Unionists of the 1850 s who accepted the principle that supply and demand regulated wages and prices The trade unions however disapproved of emigration to the where workers would go to a rival trade such emigration could not diminish the absolute number of workers in the indtry Instead they advocated emigration to farms in the colonies but nevertheless most of the persons aided by trade unions to emigrate went to the The hesitancy of skilled workers to leave a familiar occupation appeared to be the most important reason for this Desirable as emigration was to trade unionists in times of trade crises the leaders met overwhelming difficulties when they tried to e it as a safety valve In the cotton famine and the iron trade lock oof the sixties for example unions had no money to aid emigration and were forced to seek grants from manufacturers to help needy workers to go to Although they were relatively helpless in times of crisis the trade unions assisted emigration during good years believing that such a policy would ease the severity of the inevitable next crisis Most of the established unions had regularly operating emigration grants by which members in good standing could receive a sum of money in aid of emigration ually enough to pay at least one passage to This benefit helped some of the most skilled workers and loyal union members to leave for The trade unions in making these grants had to adjt the amount of money given to the state of health of the union treasury th during crises when the treasuries were low the emigration benefits were often discontinued As the years passed and the number of workers in increased the unions hesitated to send men abroad during depressions or strikes in the Not only did workmen complain of such competition but also workers disliked to see men whom they had previoly assisted to take their labour abroad return home From 1850 until well into the 1880 s when most of the trade unions were encouraging and aiding emigration their influence actually was most effective toward that end in times of prosperity in the It was the depression of the eighties and the rise of unions of illed workers and leaders who looked for improvement through Socialism rather than through adjting the supply of

opportunity to observe how robt the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins Although certain differences are found among the four submodels the overwhelming feature is their similarity Where differences do exist they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process Clearly a villager s previo history of movement is a key factor affecting squent movement and the entire decision making process The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans Except in one submodel evaluations have a significant effect on plans and the existence of plans which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts information and evaluations is the only factor other than previo mobility which has a significant direct effect on squent

modification by inpderiving from a source external to the village itself It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly though both could be indirectly influenced by

plays a very specific role namely that of the age structure Yet becae this structure varied little up to the nineteenth century demographers remained unaware of its importance for many years Consequently it was thanks above all to its disruptive influence on comparisons based on crude rates that age composition became a specific topic of study It was not until later in a more recent period that the need to extend these studies to other areas of key importance became clear and it is Mr Sauvy who holds the honour of being the first scholar in to highlight the economic consequences of ageing 1 The effects of age structure are multiple First in the purely demographic field and aside from the technical problems it raises age structure is often one of the reasons behind the slow speed at which many demographic phenomena emerge For example a reduction in fertility to below replacement levels does not immediately produce a surpl of deaths over births in a becae as cohorts of increasing size enter their reproductive lives the number of births continto rise for some years while the increase in deaths is temporarily slowed by a decline in deaths of young children who account for a notable share of all deaths Births th continue to greatly outnumber deaths for many years even if fertility declines santially The people s persistent lack of concern for such an alarming demographic situation can be attributed to this circance and likewise to immigration which also masks their inadequate level of fertility We note indeed that it is above all through changes in age structure that immigration has played this role for the increase in size resulting from inflows of foreigners alone would not have given such a misleading impression had these foreigners not arrived at childbearing ages ages at which mortality is low th swelling the numbers of births while barely affecting numbers of deaths The balance of births and deaths could th remain favourable for longer failing to reflect for several decades the profound internal imbalance of the The age structure th influences the prospects of a country in a relatively near future It also modifies them over a longer time scale Hence all other things being equal same fertility and same mortality a million citizens drawn at random in or the and a million people giving birth and dying in the same way as these and would not give the same figure 100 years from now by which time the and would be almost 20 more numero than their counterparts 2 These demographic effects of age structure are compounded by economic effects whose importance cannot be understated This is jt one of the many points where economic and demographic phenomena are interlinked Indeed it was through a strange aberration that political economy of which demography was originally a major chapter lost interest in this part of its domain leaving statisticians to pe the exploration alone and to establish demography as an independent discipline economists in the meantime confined man the key factor of production and consumption to the mere role of economic entity homo economic placed on the same footing as banknotes wheat coal transportation capital and services all trampled upon by the implacable mechanism of a wretched harmony It was only under the pressure of social circance that political economy agreed to a somewhat more human approach and returned its attention to what in a man is more than jt a worker or a purchaser in possession or otherwise of money As economists th achieved a more realistic conception of production and consumption new horizons opened up before their eyes notably regarding both the economic consequences of demographic phenomena and the demographic effects of economic factors', 'visualising the demographic factors which shape age structure The pyramid is one of the most popular tools for visualising age structure However it is difficult to discern from the diagram the relative effects of different demographic components on the size of age specific populations making it hard to understand exactly how a s age structure is formed OBJECTIVEThe aim of this paper is to introduce a type of pyramid which shows how births deaths and migration have shaped a s age structure DATA AND Births deaths and data were obtained from the Human Mortality Database and the Bureau of Statistics A variation on the conventional pyramid termed here a components of change pyramid was created Based on cohort accounts it illtrates how births deaths and net migration have created the of

illtrate how births deaths and net migration have fashioned current age structures The influence of migration is shown to vary greatly between populations The new type of pyramid aids interpretation of a s age structure and helps to understand its demographic history over the last century']"

which this subject aroed comparable ferment was in the 1920s At that time the main sources of migrants were not of the but self described overpopulated in In May 1924 one such country convened what became known as the First Emigration and Immigration Conference Held in the meeting was attended by delegates from 57 and the Among its resolutions was an Emigrants Charter recognizing rights to emigrate and immigrate but with strong provisos Th the right to immigrate was subject to restrictions imposed for economic and social reasons based in particular on the state of the labour market and the necessity of safeguarding the hygienic and moral interests of the country of immigration see the Notes on Migration section in Indtrial and Labour Information Vol XI July Sept 1924 pp 54 68 A more systematic discon of these putative rights appeared in an article published a few months earlier by a prominent jurist Paul Fauchille which is excerpted below The rights to emigrate and to immigrate are seen as broad and fairly symmetrical able to be limited by a state only by appeal to its own right of self preservation Circribing the right to emigrate may seem dated in the light of the blanket provision in Article 13 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has the right to leave any country including his own and to return to his country In Fauchille s extreme case a state can seek to prohibit the wholesale flight of its However on immigration about which the Universal Declaration is silent self preservation yields a longer list of grounds for restriction An issue with contemporary resonance is whether those grounds can include the wish by a state to prevent a fion of races which might alter its ethnic character or obliterate its national culture Restriction on such a basis would be jtified says Fauchille only where the intending migrants belonged to an absolutely different civilisation and were large in number Paul Fauchille 1858 1926 was an expert in law

but rather the needs of in terms of immigration Jt after the Liberation lacked the necessary manpower to undertake its economic reconstruction and the idea of recruiting foreign workers as was done after the First War seemed a logical one Sauvy assumes that this utilitarian attitude to is shared by all he mentions the major contribution to be made by farmers construction workers and miners brought in from abroad But he takes the idea one step further beyond their contribution to rebuilding the economy immigrants would also provide a solution over the longer term to the country s demographic imbalance and more specifically to the challenge of ageing Like many of his contemporaries Sauvy was haunted by this problem In 1946 16 of s was aged over 60 While this was much smaller than that observed today 24 it was a record at the time as Sauvy does not fail to point out For Sauvy this abnormally high proportion was attributable to the combined effects of secular decline and the collapse of births during the Great War With considerable economy of means Sauvy ra simulation to determine s needs in terms of immigration His stated target is a as defined by Alfred Lotka namely an ideal in which young people are sufficiently numero and fertile to ensure generation replacement and to maintain the structural balance The method is extremely simple Sauvy takes the age structure of the on 1 January 1931 as indicated by the cens of that year then determines the number of old people aged 60 or above He then calculates how many additional people would be needed in the other age groin order to produce a stationary pyramid The difference between the actual situation and the model gives him the order of magnitude of the extra people needed Why e the 1931 cens as a basis Becae it is the last one held in a context of full employment Sauvy s goal of economic and demographic reconstruction does not imply taking back to the conditions prevailing before the war but aims rather to return to the level that preceded the crisis of the 1930s The conclion he draws is striking will not return to demographic equilibrium unless it brings in some 5 290 000 immigrants among whom 2 450

The limiting factors are all proportional to the square of the present size p 2 and comprise a war term w that aids the growth limiting process a prosperity term g that inhibits the limiting process

net immigration in connection with making projections As a further development the period fertility method of projecting births gave way in the 1960 s to the cohort fertility method Consideration is now being given to vario methods involving parity progression procedures Some alternative methods and problems of measuring the accuracy of projections are then considered The percent error in the projected growth by components and age and the range from high to low expressed as a percent should also be examined in addition to the percent error in the total However accuracy is measured the projections made in the 1930 s and 1940 s were often wide of the mark and those made in the 1950 s and 1960 s failed to anticipate the sharp changes which occurred even though the actual figures ually fell within the range projected Elaboration of projection methodology has not resulted in any great increase in the precision of the projections largely becae birth rates have fluctuated widely and the fluctuations have proven difficult if not impossible to predict The projections of hoeholds have had a roughly similar history and the methods and problems of evaluation are somewhat similar Their development has been characterized by the introduction of alternative and changing headship rates and increasing disaggregation of the data and procedures The paper concludes with some generalizations based on U S experience Although refinement of methods may contribute little to accuracy accuracy is only one aspect of the efulness of projections The need for conditional projections and their analytical efulness are such that there is no qion that we should confidently continue to make them', 'the s new projections of the On the basis of best estimate projections between 1992 and 2050

of college graduates Internal migration statistics are generally inadequate One of the chief sources of this is the lack of direct data relating to migration There appears also to be a lack of interest on the part of researchers in ping the study of the relationship between vertical mobility and migration This study is designed to determine the relative importance of intergenerational vertical mobility and type of community or place of origin in contributing to the migration of college graduates by ing direct mobility and migration data The study sample consists of 850 employed male graduates of eight private colleges in between 1954 and 1958 Data were obtained through the colleges and consist among other things of information about fathers occupations graduates occupations and the addresses of graduates both at matriculation and at the time of the study Information about or places of origin is dichotomized on the basis of whether they are located in Standard Metropolitan Areas SMA s in 1950 or whether they are located in non SMA s NSMA s Upward mobility is treated as a product of higher education and as an antecedent of migration Hypotheses asserting the existence of associations between mobility and migration and between type of community or place of origin and migration are tested Associations are established showing 1 that upwardly mobile graduates are more likely to migrate than others and 2 that graduates from NSMA s are more likely to migrate than graduates from SMA s The relative influence of the two factors is determined by partialing the associations between each factor and migration while holding the other factor constant Type of community or place of origin is found to be of greater importance for migration than is upward mobility Graduates from NSMA s are more likely to migrate than those from SMA s regardless of their relative mobility Graduates from SMA s are likely to migrate only if they are also upwardly mobile',
